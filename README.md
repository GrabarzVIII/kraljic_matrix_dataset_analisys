# Kraljic Matrix Analysis

## 📌Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing procurement strategies using the Kraljic Matrix, a strategic tool for supply management. The analysis is based on a dataset from Kaggle, which categorizes products based on two dimensions: profit impact and supply risk.

* **Dataset:** [Procurement Strategy Dataset for Kraljic Matrix on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahriarkabir/procurement-strategy-dataset-for-kraljic-matrix)
* **Objective:** To analyze and visualize procurement categories using the Kraljic Matrix, providing insights into product classification.
